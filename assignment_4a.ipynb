    "#### Instructions on how to use this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for various models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "!nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

A VAE is a likelihood-based deep generative model that consists of a stochastic encoder (a variational posterior over latent variables), a stochastic decoder, and a marginal distribution over latent variables (a.k.a. a prior). The model was originally proposed in two concurrent papers:\n",

    "### Theory behind VAEs\n",
    "\n",
    "VAEs are latent variable models trained with variational inference. In general, the latent variable models define the following generative process:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "1.\\ & \\mathbf{z} \\sim p_{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{z}) \\\\\n",
    "2.\\ & \\mathbf{x} \\sim p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, we assume that for observable data $\\mathbf{x}$, there are some latent (hidden) factors $\\mathbf{z}$. Then, the training objective is log-likelihood function of the following form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log p_{\\vartheta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\log \\int p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\mathbf{z}) p_\\lambda(\\mathbf{z}) \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{z} .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is the intractability of the integral if the dependencies between random variables $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{z}$ are non-linear and/or the distributions are non-Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing variational posteriors $q_{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})$, we get the following lower bound (the Evidence Lower Bound, ELBO):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log p_{\\vartheta}(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid \\mathbf{x})}\\left[\\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\mathbf{z})\\right]-\\mathrm{KL}\\left(q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid \\mathbf{x}) \\| p_\\lambda(\\mathbf{z})\\right) .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we want to *maximize* this objective, therefore, in the code you are going to have to implement NELBO (negative ELBO) as a loss function (i.e., a minimization task). "

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
